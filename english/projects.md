<h3>Design and Security Interaction of the Collaborative Mobile Platform Based on YuMi Robot</h3>
<p>
This project is the graduation design for my bachelor degree. Based on ABB's dual arm cooperative robot--YuMi, this paper designs a cooperative mobile platform for helping the elderly and disabled people and medical care. This design includes the mechanical structure design, electrical system design and the programming of the software program. The 3D modeling and physical construction building have been completed, and the simulation and debugging of the software program have been carried out. This design is safe, efficient, convenient and practical. Below is the video demo of this project.

<h3>A Novel Gesture Recognition System for Intelligent Interaction with a Nursing-Care Assistant Robot</h3>
<p>
This project proposed an innovative hand motion trajectory (HMT) gesture recognition system based on background velocity features. Here, a new wearable wrist-worn camera prototype for gestureâ€™s video collection was designed, and a new method for the segmentation of continuous gestures was shown. Meanwhile, a nursing-care assistant robot prototype was designed for assisting the elderly, which is capable of carrying the elderly with omnidirectional motion and grabbing the specified object at home. In order to evaluate the performance of the gesture recognition system, 10 special gestures were defined as the move commands for interaction with the robot. The hardware part of wearable wrist camera is completed independently by Chen Feiyu, and the software program is modified based on Chen Feiyu's code foundation, and then connects with the interface of nursing-care robot in my graduation design project to realize gesture control. In this project, ten kinds of gesture commands are defined to control the movement of the robot. Below is the video demo of this project.
